# OTC

This repository contains the code from the paper "Optimal Transport for Stationary Markov Chains via Policy Iteration" by O'Connor et al. found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07998). We provide a Matlab implementation of both the ExactOTC and EntropicOTC algorithms as well as the code to reproduce the experimental results described in the paper.

Most of the functions in the `ot_algorithms` folder are adaptations of functions provided [here](https://github.com/JasonAltschuler/OptimalTransportNIPS17). The code for training the classical music HMMs is adapted from code provided [here](https://github.com/aky4wn/Classical-Music-Composition-Using-State-Space-Models).
